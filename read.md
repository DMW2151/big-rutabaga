## Geospatial Data

I'm interested in different ways to represent and query locations, enough so that the topic warranted it's own section.

- [How Geohashes Work](https://www.factual.com/blog/how-geohashes-work/) - Primer on geohashes, examples in Java

- [Filling a Geofence with Geohashes](https://willdemaine.ghost.io/filling-geofences-with-geohashes/) - Nice application of the properties of geohashes to fill a polygon

- [Geospatial Indexing on Hilbert Curves](https://blog.zen.ly/geospatial-indexing-on-hilbert-curves-2379b929addc) - Discussion of Google's S2 and the underlying properties of most spatial indexes
  
- [Line Simplification](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/simplify/) - From one of the key developers of [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), discussion of algorithms used shrink polygon's resolution without removing important features. Discusses **Ramer-Douglas-Peucker** and **Visvalingam-Whyatt**.
