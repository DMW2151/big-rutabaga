## Where I've Worked

- [Geophy](https://geophy.com/) - **Data Engineer** - I move data using tools like [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/index.html), [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/documentation/), and [DBT](https://docs.getdbt.com/)

- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - **Content Contributor** - I develop interactive lessons, quizzes, and projects   to break down technical concepts into digestible exercises. Here are some of the courses I've worked on:
  - [DB Design With PostgeSQL](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/design-databases-with-postgresql)
  - [Statistics With Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/master-statistics-with-python)

## What I'm Working On

Most of the below is at least in part inspired by something I've read recently, see some of my [favorites](/big-rutabaga/read).

--------

### 2021

- **2021-03-22** - [Rolled My Own Tileserver Against Better Judgement](/big-rutabaga/posts/tileserver-1) - You're not supposed to serve tiles directly from a DB.

- **2021-03-17** - [Accidentally Learned A lot About Jupyter Notebooks](/big-rutabaga/posts/datadive) - I spent the weekend working using *~AI for Social Good~*. Results on that front were under-whelming, but I learned quite a bit about deploying a JupyterHub instance.

- **2020-03-01** - [Self-Hosted Docker Registry](/big-rutabaga/posts/private-docker) - I've accumulated quite a few Docker images, I should host them on a private registry.
