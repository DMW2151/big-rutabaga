## Where I've Worked

- [Geophy](https://geophy.com/) - **Data Engineer** - I move data using tools like [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/index.html), [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/documentation/), and [DBT](https://docs.getdbt.com/).

- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - **Content Contributor** - I develop interactive lessons, quizzes, and projects to break down technical concepts into digestible exercises. Here are some of the courses I've worked on:
  - [DB Design With PostgeSQL](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/design-databases-with-postgresql)
  - [Statistics With Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/master-statistics-with-python)
